# OnlineCoffeeStore
Hello!
This is a simple PHP project for my PHP course in college.

#Summary
The 'customer' selects their type of coffee,
if they want regular or decaf, and how many they want.
They also input their information including address, name,
number, etc.

After they submit the form, the information is sent to the coffee_display.php file.
The information is then displayed (also includes the calculated total cost of the order) in a table.
